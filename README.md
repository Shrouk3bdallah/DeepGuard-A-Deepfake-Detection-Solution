# DeepGuard-A-Deepfake-Detection-Solution
Deepfake technology has become increasingly sophisticated and accessible, posing a significant threat to individuals, organizations, and society as a whole. In response, researchers and developers have been working on developing deepfake detection solutions to mitigate the risks associated with this technology.

This github presents DeepGuard, a deepfake detection solution developed by a team of computer science students at Thebes Higher Institute for Management and Information Technology.

The solution utilizes a combination of deep learning algorithms and image processing techniques to detect and classify deepfake videos with high accuracy.

The repository provides a detailed description of the solution's architecture, including the data collection and preprocessing stages, the deep learning models used for classification, and the evaluation metrics used to assess the solution's performance.

The results of the evaluation show that DeepGuard achieves high accuracy in detecting deepfake videos, outperforming existing state-of-the-art solutions. The repository concludes by discussing the potential applications of DeepGuard in various domains, including social media, journalism, and law enforcement, and highlighting the importance of continued research and development in the field of deepfake detection.
